## Overview
Nowadays, computers have become more and more inseparable from our daily life. Companies need computers to process big data; students need computers to access many online resources; scientists need computers to conduct and analyze research experiments. Various software applications make our lives more interesting and convinient, and numerous algorithms facilitate analytics work easier and more efficient. Undoubtedly, computer science is conquering the world. And learning computer science can definitely be one of the never-regret life choice!

Ok. We've already known that learning computer science is useful, and would love to. But how? This may be a silly question, as almost all universities have computer science as a major. But consider those who have already left university, or who did not get the chance to enter the university. How can they access computer science study?

So here comes **CSLOL -- the best place for people at all ages and with all education background to study CS**!

CSLOL is a web application which serves for a mocking "non-school school" educational institution that specifically teaches computer science. Here, the "non-school school" means that on one hand, it provides high-quality computer science courses, either online or offline, and contains high-quality teaching resources that would take responsibility of designing couress and assignments, grading homework, making exams, etc. On the other hand, different from official schools, it has not requirement on students' previous educational background, and is open to people at all ages. It has less requirements than official schools, but provides as good education as official schools!
